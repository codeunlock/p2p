why we use json:

While JSON is a versatile and widely-used data interchange format, it's not without its limitations. One of the main issues with JSON is its lack of support for more complex data types such as binary data or custom data structures. This can be a problem when dealing with applications that require transmitting non-textual data, such as images or audio files. Additionally, JSON can be verbose, especially when dealing with nested or repetitive data structures, which can lead to increased network bandwidth usage and slower parsing times. Another challenge with JSON is its lack of built-in support for handling circular references or complex object graphs, which can make serialization and deserialization error-prone in certain scenarios. Finally, while JSON is relatively lightweight, it may not be the most efficient choice for high-performance applications or systems with strict latency requirements. In such cases, binary protocols or more compact serialization formats like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack may be more suitable alternatives.

data = connection.recv(1024)

In the Tracker file, the line data = connection.recv(1024) is used to receive data from a connected peer over the network.

Here's what it means:

connection: This variable represents a connection object obtained when a peer connects to the Tracker's listening socket. It is a socket object that allows communication with the connected peer.

recv(1024): This method is used to receive data from the connected peer. The parameter 1024 specifies the maximum amount of data (in bytes) to be received at once. In this case, it's set to 1024 bytes, meaning the Tracker will attempt to receive up to 1024 bytes of data from the connected peer.

After executing this line, the data variable will contain the data received from the connected peer. In the context of the Tracker, this data typically represents a message or command sent by a peer, encoded in bytes.

The received data is then processed further, typically by decoding it from bytes to a string format (using .decode()), parsing it (e.g., parsing JSON data), and performing actions based on the content of the received message.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

line 79: server_socket.bind(('localhost', self.port))
Double parenthesis | With one gave this: 
TypeError: socket.bind() takes exactly one argument (2 given)

The bind() method of a socket object in Python expects a single argument, which is a tuple containing the host address and the port number. Therefore, when you call server_socket.bind(('localhost', self.port)), you're passing a single argument, which is a tuple containing the host address and port number.

The double parentheses (()) are used to create a tuple literal in Python. Even though it might seem like you're passing two arguments due to the presence of the parentheses, it's actually interpreted as a single argument, which is the tuple.

The error you encountered, TypeError: socket.bind() takes exactly one argument (2 given), occurs when you mistakenly pass more than one argument to the bind() method.
